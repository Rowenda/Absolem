<p>How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze. Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the dark.</p>
<p>I'm allergic to bee stings. They cause me to, uh, die. A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow…and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner. Uh, no, you got the wrong number. This is 9-1…2.</p>
<p>I don't like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there's too many fat children. I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming. Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about!</p>
